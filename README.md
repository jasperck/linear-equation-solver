##Linear Equation Solver for Upper-Triangular Matrix

A work for Computer Programming Course at National Taiwan University.

#####ZX = Y
| Z1 | Z2 | Z3 |   | X1 |   | Y1 |
| 0  | Z4 | Z5 | * | X2 | = | Y2 |
| 0  | 0  | Z6 |   | X3 |   | Y3 |

Calculate X[] by given array Z[] and Y[], array Z[] is a Upper-Triangular Matrix.
