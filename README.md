##Linear Equation Solver for Upper-Triangular Matrix

A work for Computer Programming Course at National Taiwan University.

#####ZX = Y
| z1 | z2 | z3 |   | x1 |   | y1 |
|----|----|----|---|----|---|----|
| 0  | z4 | z5 | * | x2 | = | y2 |
| 0  | 0  | 6  |   | x3 |   | y3 |

Calculate X[ ] by given array Z[ ] and Y[ ], array Z[ ] is a Upper-Triangular Matrix.
